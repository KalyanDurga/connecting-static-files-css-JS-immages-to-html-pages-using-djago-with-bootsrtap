    <center><h1 ;">Crops in INDIA</h1></center>
    <p >India stands as a pinnacle-producing country in the world. Agriculture is considered the way of life, and farmers are treated as Gods. There are several Major
         Crops In India like Food grains -Rice, Wheat, Maize, Millets and Pulses, Cash Crops- Cotton, Jute, Sugarcane, Tobacco, and Oilseeds, Plantation Crops-Tea, Coffee,
          Coconut and, Rubber and Horticulture crops- Fruits and Vegetables. Cotton, which is the natural fibre, grows on plants, and Gujarat is India’s largest cotton
           producing state. Similarly, the crops are accordingly divided based on seasons and the cultivation suitably.
    </p>
    <p >India is now the world’s second-largest producer of agricultural products. India is an agricultural country, with agriculture providing a living for more than 60%
         of the population. While we may not understand the importance of agriculture while living in metropolitan areas, it is a well-known truth that agriculture is the
          primary source of income for most of our country’s people.
        The population of India is outpacing the country’s ability to produce rice and wheat, which are the  Major Crops In India. The amount of money needed to construct
         marketing, storage, and cold storage infrastructure is projected to be enormous. Numerous crops, ranging from medicinal to grain crops, are grown throughout the 
         country. These commodities are utilized for various purposes, including human consumption, industry, and animal feed.</p>

    <h1 id="h2" ">Types of Major Crops In India:-</h1>
    <h2>Based on seasons, Major Crops In India are classified as follows:</h2>

    <h1 >Karif:-</h1>
    <p id="p">The Kharif crop is also known as the monsoon crop in India. They are typically sown with the starting of the rains in July and during the southwest monsoon season.
         Gujarat is the largest cotton producing state in India. The prime Kharif crops in India include Millets, Cotton, Soyabean, Sugarcane, Turmeric, Rice, Maize, Pulses,
          Groundnut, etc. West Bengal, UP, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, and Tamil Nadu are India’s major rice production states. However, the cultivation varies from region to 
          region.</p>

        <h1 >2. Rabi</h1>
        <p id="p">The Rabi crops are also known as winter crops or Spring harvest. The seeds are sown in the last month of October and harvested in the middle of March and April. This is exactly the opposite of Kharif crops. The main Rabi crops in India include Wheat, Barley, Mustard, Sesame, Peas, etc. These are usually grown in Dry areas.</p>

                <h2 >storage</h2>
                <p id="p">Grain and other Major Crops In India must be preserved after harvesting. Without enough storage facilities, insects, worms, fungi, and numerous bacteria will damage the grain. Similarly, lack of enough moisture and proper temperature at the storage location increases the risk of grain rotting. As a result of these factors, grain quality deteriorates, its weight drops, and its capacity to bear grain decreases. The following summarises some of the strategies that have been developed to keep grain from deteriorating and to keep it safe in storage:

                    <p id="p"> Drying: Grain can be dried in the sun or exposed to hot or warm air.</p>
                    <p id="p">Maintenance of storage vessels: There should be no fractures or holes in the godown, sacks, tanks, or containers used for grain storage. </p>
                    <p id="p"> Chemical treatment: The godowns and storage vessels are sprayed with pesticides or fungicides chemicals before storage. Also utilised is fumigation. 
                        <p id="p">Neem leaves, black pepper, and oil are also used to protect the grain. </p>
                        <p id="p">Vessels related to storage: They are devoid of air, rodents and wetness. </p>
                        <p id="p">Buffer Stocks: Buffer stocks are grains obtained by the Government through FCI that supply wheat & rice where farmers are paid a fixed amount for 
                    their crops.</p>
                    <p id="p">Public distribution system: The grain obtained from the FCI is provided to the poorest members of society through state-run ration outlets, which 
                    are called ‘The Public Distribution System’.</p>
